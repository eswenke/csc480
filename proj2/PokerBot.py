"""
RULES ***
Players: 
    -2 (your bot vs. one opponent).
No Betting: 
    - Decisions are limited to “fold” or “stay.”
Card Dealing Phases:
    - Pre-Flop: Each player receives 2 private cards (hole cards).
    - Flop: 3 community cards are revealed.
    - Turn: 1 additional community card is revealed.
    - River: 1 final community card is revealed.
Decision Points: 
    - Before each phase bot has 10 seconds to decide whether to fold or stay.
Hidden Information:
    - Your bot can see its own hole cards and any revealed community cards.
    - The opponent's hole cards remain hidden unless both players stay until the River.
Win Condition: 
    - If neither player folds, the highest-ranking hand wins

REQUIREMENTS ***
    - Implement Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
    - Estimate winning probability at each decision point
    - For each decision:
        - Random Rollouts:
            - Similute possible opponent cards (just in their hand)
            - Simulate random community cards
            - Play out the showdown randomly
        - Select Policy:
            - Use UCB1 to guide exploration during simulations
            - Track wins vs. losses
            - Calculate Win probability as wins/simulations
        - Decision Rule:
            - Stay (check) if win probability is greater than or equal to 50%
            - Fold if less than 50%
        - Complete all simulations and decision making within 10 seconds at each decision point

TECHNICAL DETAILS ***
    - Represent each hand as a tuple ('2', 'S') for 2 of spades, ('A', 'H') for Ace of Hearts, etc.
    - Community cards are a list of 3, 4, or 5 cards
    - Deck Management:
        - Implement shuffling and drawing mechanics
        - Ensure no duplicate cards are drawn
        - Simulate from the remaining deck correctly
    - Hand Evaluation:
        - Implement a function to evaluate hand rankings
    - Maximize the number of simulations done within the 10 seconds
    - Implement all components from scratch (deck, evaluation, rollout, etc.)
